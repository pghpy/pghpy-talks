## I'd like to hear someone talk about a specific topic. How do I propose it to the group?

Create an issue in the [issues tab](https://github.com/pghpy/pghpy-talks/issues) of this repository. Include a title and description of the topic you're interested in learning about or hearing someone talk about. If you know someone that might be interested in talking about it, or you want to talk about it yourself, please note that in the comments. You can also use the C&S [speakers form](http://www.codeandsupply.co/speakers) or post in the #python C&S Slack channel.

## I'd like to give a talk, but I don't have a topic.

Great! Check out the list of ideas in the [issues tab](https://github.com/pghpy/pghpy-talks/issues) and see if there's anything that matches your knowledge or experience. We welcome all experience levels and any topics related to Python, whether technical, project-oriented, or something else creative.

## How long does a talk need to be?

_Any_ length of talk is great. For shorter talks (~20 minutes or less), we would try to schedule it with someone else who also wants to give a shorter talk. This could be "themed" (similar topics) but doesn't have to be. We also try to organize lightning talks approx. once a year, which involves a number of people giving very short, 5 minute talks (slides optional!).
